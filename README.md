#### NetflixDashboard
#### Creating a Netflix Dashboard using Tableau

###### Introduction:
In this project, I have analysed Netflix dataset.

###### Data:
The dataset is taken from YouTube. It consists of a csv file.

The file consists of 12 fields and 6234 rows. The fields are Show ID, Type (Movie or a TV Show), Title, Director,Cast, Country, Date Added to Netflix, Release Year, Rating,Duration, Listed In and description.

###### Approach:
* Connecting the data to data source. In my case, the data is in the form of csv file.
* Create worksheets to design the required visualization like Top 10 genres, Total Number of shows,etc,
* Create a new dashboard and add all the relevant worksheets and perform all the necessary filtering options.
